# Dart List Practice â€“ Beginner Level ðŸš€

This repository contains multiple small Dart programs that demonstrate how to work with `List` in Dart using various methods and logic. The goal is to learn how to create, manipulate, and explore different operations on lists through simple examples.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### âœ… Q1: Create a List of Names and Print All

- A simple list of chocolates' names.
- Demonstrates how to create a list and print it directly.

### âœ… Q2: Create a List of Days and Print Only Sunday

- A list of all weekdays is created.
- The `.last` property is used to access Sunday.

### âœ… Q3: Create a List Containing Name, Class, Roll No, Grade, and Percentage

- A nested list (`List<List>`) is used to store multiple records.
- One record is accessed and printed to demonstrate nested list access.

### âœ… Q4: Find Smallest and Greatest Number in a List

- A list of integers is iterated using a `for` loop.
- Conditional logic is used to find the minimum and maximum numbers manually.

### âœ… Q5: Return the Maximum Value from a List

- Another way to manually find the maximum value from a list using a temporary variable.

### âœ… Q6: Reverse a List Without Changing the Original

- A list is reversed using `.reversed.toList()` to create a new list.
- The original list remains unchanged.

### âœ… Q7: Use 15 List Methods (excluding `retainWhere` and `removeWhere`)

Multiple types of lists are used:
- `numbers` (int)
- `names` (String)
- `mix` (dynamic)
- `dupes` (with duplicates)

**Methods used include:**

1. `.reversed`
2. `.length`
3. `.add()`
4. `.addAll()`
5. `.insert()`
6. `.insertAll()`
7. `.removeAt()`
8. `.removeLast()`
9. `.clear()`
10. `.isEmpty`
11. `.isNotEmpty`
12. `.sort()`
13. `.sublist()`
14. `.shuffle()`
15. `.indexOf()` and updating a value using index.
